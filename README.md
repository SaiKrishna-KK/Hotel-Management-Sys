# Hotel Management System

## Aim
The aim of this project is to modernize the traditional hotel management system into a computerized one. Instead of using conventional methods such as ledgers and bulk files, this Java project offers a seamless, accessible and efficient hotel management system.

## Technologies Used
This project is developed using Swing, which is a window-based application creator. MySQL is used for database management, allowing the system to store login data and verify user credentials. Swing and MySQL are used in conjunction with JAVA to create the Hotel Management windows application.

## Assumptions
This project assumes that the user is using Windows 7 or higher, or an open-source operating system. Additionally, only the administrator can access the application and edit various information.

## Features
The Hotel Management application offers the following functions:
1. Create customer forms
2. Search rooms
3. Manage staff (Add, Update, Delete, and View)
4. Manage guests (Add, Update, and View)
5. Manage room details (Add, Update, Delete, and View)
6. Manage pricing details (Set prices, Update, and View)

## Sample Scenarios
If the Hotel LearnNXT implements this Hotel Management application, major hotel operations will be automated. The system tracks room status, prices, and check-in availability. If a guest wants to extend their stay, updating the room status and pricing can be done with ease. Since the application is used by the administrator, staff details can be added, updated, and managed with ease. If any guest information is updated, every thread linked to that particular guest will have the same update. For example, if a guest wants to extend their stay, this change will reflect in the billing section and room status. The end-user, which is the hotel administrator, can manage and monitor all of this information with ease using this automated hotel management system.

## Real-Life Applications
This project is based on a real-life application. It provides high-performance speed along with accuracy while keeping track of user data. By adding graphics and making it more user-friendly, connecting the application to a centralized server via the internet could expand its scope. Because the data can be accessed, managed, and monitored from anywhere. Although JAVA is platform-independent, developing an Android and iOS application for this Hotel Management System may lead to some constraints. If these constraints are resolved, the application's scope would be seamless and would allow even small-scale hotels to convert from conventional methods. By changing, updating, and adjusting a few classes in the program, the application can be used for various other management systems, such as Student Management System, University Management System, Library Management System, etc.
